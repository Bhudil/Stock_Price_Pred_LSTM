## Introduction
Stock price prediction is a challenging task due to the complex and volatile nature of the stock market. In this project, we use a deep learning approach, specifically an LSTM model, to capture the temporal dependencies in the stock data and make accurate predictions.


## Dataset
The dataset used in this project consists of historical stock data for a particular company. The data includes the following features:
Date
Open
High
Low
Close
Adjusted Close
Volume


The dataset is split into a training set and a test set, with the training set used to train the model and the test set used for evaluation.


## Model Architectur
The LSTM model used in this project has the following architecture:
LSTM layer with 100 units and return_sequences=True
Dropout layer with a rate of 0.2
Bidirectional LSTM layer with 100 units and return_sequences=True
Dropout layer with a rate of 0.2
LSTM layer with 100 units
Dropout layer with a rate of 0.2
Dense layer with 10 units and ReLU activation
Dense layer with 1 unit (the predicted stock price)
The model is compiled with the mean squared error loss function and the Adam optimizer.


## Training
The model is trained for 150 epochs with early stopping based on the loss function. The training process is monitored using the EarlyStopping callback, which stops the training if the loss does not improve for 10 consecutive epochs.


## Evaluation
The trained model is evaluated on the test set, and the predicted stock prices are compared to the actual stock prices. Evaluation metrics such as mean squared error (MSE) and root mean squared error (RMSE) are used to assess the model's performance.


## Usage
To use the stock price prediction model, follow these steps:
Clone the repository: git clone https://github.com/your-username/stock-price-prediction.git
Install the required dependencies (see the Dependencies section)
Prepare your own stock data in the same format as the provided dataset
Update the file paths in the code to point to your dataset
Run the Jupyter Notebook or Python script to train the model and make predictions


## Dependencies
